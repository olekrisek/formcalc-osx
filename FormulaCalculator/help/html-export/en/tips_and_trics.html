    Here is a collection of useful hints.&nbsp;<div><ul><li>Change operator: if you typed an operator, and suddenly realize that you should have typed another, you can change just pushing the operator you want. If you accidentally pushed +, but wanted -, just push - and see that the formula change accordingly in the formula view. If you have wrote something more before you discover the fault, the edit key let you edit your formula in any way you want.&nbsp;</li><li>If you want a negative number after an operator, you can use the "+/-" button after entering the last number, like writing 2* -2: push "2", "*", &nbsp;"2", "+/-". Pushing the regular "-" button after the "*" will only change the operator, as in the paragraph above.&nbsp;</li><li>Shortcust: if you want a formula like 2*(... you can just push 2, and (, and the * appears in the midle automatically. Likewise 2pi, becomes 2*pi. The * is inserted because the calculation engine depends on it to calculate correctly. If you edit your formula, you cant write 2(, &nbsp;since this automatic is only done when entering from the keypad.&nbsp;</li><li>Sometimes, a complex formula is more easely entered in the edit-mode directly. You can also copy formulas you use often (from yellow stickers, to example), and paste them into the edit-field when needed. In the edit-field you can use the navigation buttons, and more. The result will be exacltly the same, since the text is the only source the calculator use to obtain its result.&nbsp;</li><li>The formula in the formula view can be selected and copied into a document you are working on. The blue display as well as the bottom drawer have selectable text.&nbsp;</li><li>The "e" and the "EE" key have different function, even if they both insert the letter "e" into the formula. The letter "e" in conjunction with operators or standing alone, is the constant e = 2.71828 as the base number in the natural logarithm, &nbsp;while the letter "e" as part of a number denotes scientific notation like 2e3 = 2000. 2e-3 = 0.002. If the letter "e" comes directly after a numeric value, it denotes scientific notation, and a new number, positive or negative will adjust the descimal position of the number. This is useful when entering extremely small or large values. Like 1 Terrabyte = 1e12 byte, or 1nm = 1e-9 meters. The button EE is for scientific notation, and the button "e" is the constant. Scientific notation is sometimes written like 2*10^3, that is the matematical formula for the notation.&nbsp;</li><li>When you do calculations, have a look at the formula field to see that what you have entered is what you want. It is always a good idea when using an calculator in general, to do a aproximation in your mind to what kind of result to expect, like 2+2 cant be 400. Looking over the formula to see that everything is entered correctly would be a part of this.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>
