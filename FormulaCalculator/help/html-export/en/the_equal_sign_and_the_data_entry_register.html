<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">When you enter numbers in
the calculator. While we enter the number, it goes into a data
register. It is not moved into the formula before we do anything that
tell that the data entry is complete. The formula area is displayed
in this way, with a “_” after the number. When we press “=”
the formula is calculated one final time, and moved down to line two
in the formula area, included with the result. If you want to do
anything more with it now, you have to push the “edit” button,
before you write anything else. You can also select and copy the
text, to a notes book, or something if you need it later.</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">When the formula is
finalized and moved to the second line, it is never recalculated
again. If you have used variables in your formula, you and you want
to play with different values, you need to do that before you press
the “=” sign. A line below the formula show what variable values
it is calculated with. This is for documentation use, and to make you
confident that you have the right answer. Before it is finalized, you
have “=&gt; &lt;number&gt;  with &lt;variables&gt; on the second
line. This is for cut &amp; paste operations to take both formula,
variables and answer to a document even if it is only an intermediate
answer. If you change the variables, a new result appears immediately
when you tab out of the variable field.
