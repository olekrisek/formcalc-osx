    At the first look, the keyboard on the calculator looks pretty ordinary, but there is some keys that needs special attention.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><ul><li>The TAB key (---&gt;!) - This key has different function in different circumstances.&nbsp;<br>- When entering functions from the library, pushing this means that you are ready for the next parameter.&nbsp;<br>- On last parameter on a library function, this ends the function input, and close with a closing parenthesis.&nbsp;<br>- When you have finished input of a formula, and the last entry was a number. This key will give give you the answer. It differs from pushing the "=" key in the following way: "=" finalize the formula and start entering a new one, the tab key does not. If you have used variables in the formula, pressing the TAB key allows you to adjust the variables and see the answer with the new variable value.&nbsp;<br>- When there is parenthesis left open, pushing this key will append a closing parenthesis to the formula.&nbsp;</li><li>The VARS key: This key opens the left drawer containing the variables.&nbsp;</li><li>The ^ key in the bottom left corner: This alters some of the keys function. sqrt (square root) becomes cbrt (cubic root), to example.&nbsp;</li><li>The log... key: Opens a separate window with the print log. All the "=" logs the complete formula and the answer here.&nbsp;</li><li>The edit key lets you edit the current formula.&nbsp;</li><li>x, y, z, a, b, c, d, r, h, w - insert the variable in your formula. In shifted state, those assign the current result into that variable.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div></div>
