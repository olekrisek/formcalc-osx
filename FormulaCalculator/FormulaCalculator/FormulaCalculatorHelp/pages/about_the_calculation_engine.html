<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This stuff is for those who have
special interest in the method the calculation engine uses to
calculate the answer. For those who are not, its not important as it
is taken care of.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The calculator uses a recursive model
and a data stack for calculating the formulas. We go from left to
right. For equally prioritized operands we do calculate the numbers
straight forward. Like</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in">2+3+4+5+6 
</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in">We do calculate
2+3=5+4=9+5=14+6=20. 
</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">In a formula with different
priorities, like</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in">7+3*4*5*6^2+8</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Before we calculate 7+3, wee
look at the next operator that is *<b> </b><span style="font-weight: normal">then
we escalate to the next recursion level, while we leave the 7 on the
stack, the next level calculate 3*4 looking ahead that 4*5 is also
the same priority, 3*4=12, and 12*5=60, then before 60*6 is evaluated
we see that 6^2 is a higher level, so we escalate again leaving the
60 on the stack, calculate 6^2=36 (the next is +, so we do calculate
this). Now we have 7, 60, and 36 on the stack. We now return to the
second level, complete 60*36=2160, and + 8 is still at a lower level
so we return to the first level and complete 7+2160=2167, as we see
that +8 is the same level. The next is 2167+8, as we are at end there
is no more to evaluate, so we do this, 2167+8=2175. </span>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in">7+3*4*5*6^2+8=2175</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">When we come to parenthesis,
a parenthesis with a formula, basically takes position of a factor in
the equation. When we look at a factor, it can be either a number, a
constant,  a variable, a function, or a parenthesis. Every one of
these, is calculated into a number, before we go further in the
calculation. The variables and constant is taken from the memory, the
parenthesis, we do escalate to a higher recursion level to calculate
the content of the parenthesis. The same with a function as it have
its argument enclosed in parenthesis, it might be a new formula. When
we encounter the end parenthesis, we return back one level. Now we
have a single number to perform the function on, before we go on with
the next operand on this level.</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">We see that we now have
broken the whole thing down to factors and operands. Both have its
different recursion point, while the operands decide its recursion on
the next operands priority compared to the one it is to perform. The
factors recursion perform a complete evaluation of contents of
parenthesis to turn its result into a number, a factor to go on with.
Functions do the same, but perform the function on the result
returning the result as a number, a factor to go on with.</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">If there is no end of
parenthesis, the end of formula will act as one. All the recursion
levels will end at the end of the formula, performing its functions
to complete the formula. We do complete even if not all parenthesis
are closed. For intermediate result, most calculators present only
the result on the parenthesis level we HAVE closed. We do not, we
complete as they where closed. It is more likely that one has
forgotten to close a parenthesis, than leaving parts of the formula
un-calculated.</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Many calculators do
register-math or stack-math on the operations as we type the
operands, with no memory of what has been done before. Then it is
more natural to only present the top of the stack while we go. Here,
we do not preserve stack from one operation to the next, - we do
store the keystrokes in the formula, - to re-evaluate the whole
formula each time something new is appended to it.</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The advantage to this, is
that the user can see what he has entered in the formula, and then be
more confident that the result is correct. It is easy to do something
wrong, and in this way, it can be spotted and corrected instead of
re-calculate the formula to see if you got the same answer.</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">I tried the engine on a bit
complex formula, calculating the area of a tube (inside, outside and
the ends). The formula 2*pi*r*h+2*pi*x*h+2*(pi*r^2-pi*x^2), With
r=0.2, x=0.25, and h=100.000. I had to check with an ordinary
calculator to compare the result. I had to try again four times,
before I was confident I had the correct answer. Working with myCalc
was a complete different thing. &nbsp;</p>
