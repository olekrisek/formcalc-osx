    <h2>Annuity loan calculations</h2>

    The loan payment formula is used to calculate the payments on a loan. The formula used to calculate loan payments is exactly the same as the formula used to calculate payments on an ordinary annuity. A loan, by definition, is an annuity, in that it consists of a series of future periodic payments.<div><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../images/loanpayment_pic1.png"></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">Instead of entering the above formula, you can use the built in function. There is also two alternate functions, that instead of payment, gives the interest rate, or the length of the loan.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Calculating the payment:&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">Calculate fixed payments toward a loan</div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>PaymentAnnuityLoan (</b> loan sum;&nbsp;number of months; number of payments pr year; annual interest rate)&nbsp;</div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><ol><li>loan sum: The initial sum of the loan, or the restvalue of the loan.&nbsp;</li><li>number of months: Usually loans run for several years, so you have to write 12* and the number of years in this parameter.&nbsp;</li><li>number of payments pr year: This is usually 12.

If the payment sum is too small, i.e. less than the interest on the first calculations, the loan will be paid of by a negative interest. It is calculated, but the answer will be a negative value. If you have a so kind bank that accepts that, everything is fine. Some other combinations can be impossible.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Calculate the run-length of a loan:&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">Calculate years for an annuity loan given payment</div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>YearAnnuityLoan</b>( loan sum; Number of payments pr year; payment sum; annual interest rate)&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><ol><li>loan sum: The initial sum of the loan, or the restvalue of the loan.&nbsp;</li><li>number of payments pr year: This is usually 12.

The calculator loops through all the payments until done, while counting. The last period will usually be paid less, so you dont get an desimal-presition exact value, but close enough in most cases. This function gives you an idea of how long one are going to pay on a loan given a payment that is affordable.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>The ballon loan calculation</b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b><br></b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; ">This kind of loan, is nearly the same as an ordinary annuity loan, but it runs until a given rest-value instead of zero. This can be used for leasing calculations, where the loan runs for to example 3 years, and then it is estimated an rest value of, say a car that is going to be sold after the leasing period is over.
